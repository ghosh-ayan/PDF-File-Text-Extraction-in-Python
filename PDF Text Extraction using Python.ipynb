    "- `pdfminer` lets you do the entire text extraction in one or two lines of code. `PyPDF2` does not take a lot of effort either, but possibly slightly more verbose.\n",
    "- The final rendered print output from `pdfminer` seems to be a slightly better than that of PyPDF2 in terms of spacing, interpreting footers as headers properly, etc.\n",
    "- For some of the pages (e.g. title page that is more or less consisting of an image), neither the `pdfminer` nor the `PyPDF2` could extract the text. More specialized libraries for OCR might be required to handle such pages.\n",
